# Hangman App
An Android Hangman game application where users guess letters of a hidden word. 
## What I learned
-	Designed user interface within XML file using TableLayout and Button
-	Streamed hidden words from text file to .java file
## What I would like to add:
-	Create a login page for users and save users to a database
-	Allow users to send secret words to each other to guess
